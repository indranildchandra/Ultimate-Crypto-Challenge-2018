is it me or is this the best the playoffs have been in years oh yea lebron and melo in the finals
@khalid0456 No, Lebron is the best
@the_real_usher LeBron is cool.  I like his personality...he has good character.
Watching Lebron highlights. Damn that niggas good
@Lou911 Lebron is MURDERING shit.
@uscsports21 LeBron is a monsta and he is only 24. SMH The world ain't ready.
@cthagod when Lebron is done in the NBA he will probably be greater than Kobe. Like u said Kobe is good but there alot of 'good' players.
KOBE IS GOOD BT LEBRON HAS MY VOTE
Kobe is the best in the world not lebron .
